# RRANTIHAL20
experimenal proof of concept test limited to 20% hallucination reduction 
Main Function is encrypted and supports latest 0.2 torchvision along with torch 2.5 
should work with python 3.12 to 3.9
includes 2 py files . a full and seperated function along with a guide for ease of use
This is an attempt to show the power of my algorithm design capabilites in a proof of concept format which has reduction potencial (up to 100% reduction in a full version) 
uses dumbed down logic and encryption to prevent reverse engineering and limit function to only reduce by 20% 
Anybody whom wants to test this out is welcome to do try it. 
this is completely untested software ai generated solution
